    GOAL_ANALYSIS_USER = """Analyze the following goal and break it down into smaller, manageable tasks:

    Goal: {goal}

    Context of previous tasks:
    {context}

    Your objective is to:
    1. Carefully analyze the given goal, ensuring ALL aspects are covered without exception.
    2. Break it down into multiple smaller, distinct tasks that collectively achieve the entire goal.
    3. Ensure each task is specific, actionable, and contributes directly to the overall goal.
    4. Organize these tasks in a logical order of execution, considering dependencies and potential blockers.
    5. Create tasks that are completable by an AI agent with limited capabilities, using only the available tools.
    6. Include tasks for testing, validation, and quality assurance at appropriate stages.
    7. Add tasks for documentation and user instructions where necessary.

    Your output MUST be a JSON object with a 'tasks' key containing an array of task objects. Each task object should have the following format:
    {{
        "tasks": [
            {{
                "task_description": "Detailed description of the specific task",
                "estimated_complexity": "Low/Medium/High",

            }},
            // ... more tasks ...
        ]
    }}

    Remember:
    - Each task should be a single, concrete step towards achieving the overall goal.
    - Tasks should be granular and completable in a single session (15-30 minutes).
    - Include ALL necessary steps, even if they seem obvious or trivial.
    - Ensure the tasks, when completed in order, will FULLY achieve the given goal without missing any features or requirements.
    - For coding tasks, separate file creation, code implementation, and code review into distinct tasks.
    - Specify the exact filenames that need to be created or modified in each task.
    - All project source code files should be created in the 'src' folder.
    - Do not include tasks for creating directories or folders; focus on file creation and modification.
    - Add tasks for writing unit tests and performing code reviews after implementation tasks.
    - Include tasks for refactoring and optimizing code after initial implementation.
    - Always include the file_path for each task, even if it's not a coding task (use an empty string if not applicable).
    - The agent can only execute Python code directly. For HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the agent can only write and read files.
    - Do not include tasks that require external tools or environments that are not explicitly provided.
    - Include tasks for integrating different components of the project.
    - Add tasks for final testing of the complete system to ensure all features work together as intended.

    Analyze the goal thoroughly and create a comprehensive list of granular tasks to guide the agent through the entire process of achieving the objective, ensuring no aspect of the goal is overlooked.

    Ensure your response is in valid JSON format.
